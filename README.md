# My Finances
Old project that was never version controlled. It is a budgeting app that I personally use everyday. It is quite simple but does the job.

## Summary of Usage
My Finances allows you to track your bills and income. The app calculates your expenditure and shows how much funds will be available by the time next regular pay is expected to credit the user's account.
